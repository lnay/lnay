My name is Luke Naylor, and I have recently completed my PhD and looking for a role around software tools.
Right now, I am still active on some open source projects,
in particular the
[LaTeX extension](https://github.com/rzukic/zed-latex)
for the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor,
and a [language server for live preview](https://github.com/lnay/texpresso-lsp)
of LaTeX documents using [TeXpresso](https://github.com/let-def/texpresso).

I was recently a PhD student in the
[School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/)
at the
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)
supervised by
[Prof. Antony Maciocia](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antony-maciocia).
My thesis *"Criterion for the accumulation of Î½-walls"*, is published
on the [Edinburgh Research Archive](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/43553).
My mathematical research was on the topic of walls on Bridgeland stability conditions for complexes of coherent
sheaves on Picard rank 1 surfaces.
This is an area of [Algebraic Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry).
My main interest was in exposing and visualising computations in this very abstract topic of pure mathematics,
whilst heavily optimising the methods for the computations through various mathematical tricks.
For those interested in this, see the
[Pseudowalls page](pseudowalls).

In the past I was a software engineer on the compiler team at (formally)
[Micro Focus](https://www.opentext.com/microfocus)
(now the <abbr title="Application Modernisation and Connectivity (moving COBOL applications off mainframes)">AMC</abbr>
division of
~~[OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/)~~
[Rocket Software](https://www.rocketsoftware.com/)
).
