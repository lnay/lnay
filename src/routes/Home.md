I'm currently on a break sorting some home-life,
not looking to work before February 2025.
However, I am still active on some open source projects,
in particular the
[LaTeX extension](https://github.com/rzukic/zed-latex)
for the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor.

I was recently a PhD student in the
[School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/)
at the
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)
supervised by
[Prof. Antony Maciocia](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antony-maciocia).
My thesis *"Criterion for the accumulation of Î½-walls"*, has passed examination
and is pending minor corrections, and will be publicly available in due course.
My mathematical research was on the topic of walls on Bridgeland stability conditions for complexes of coherent
sheaves on Picard rank 1 surfaces.
This is an area of [Algebraic Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry).
My main interest was in exposing and visualising computations in this very abstract topic of pure mathematics.
For those interested in this, see the
[Pseudowalls page](pseudowalls).

In the past I was a software engineer on the compiler team at (formally)
[Micro Focus](https://www.opentext.com/microfocus)
(now the <abbr title="Application Modernisation and Connectivity (moving COBOL applications off mainframes)">AMC</abbr>
division of
~~[OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/)~~
[Rocket Software](https://www.rocketsoftware.com/)
).
