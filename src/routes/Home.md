I am a PhD student in the
[School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/)
at the
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)
supervised by
[Prof. Antony Maciocia](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antony-maciocia)
In the past I was a software engineer on the compiler team at (formally)
[Micro Focus](https://www.opentext.com/microfocus)
(now the <abbr title="Application Modernisation and Connectivity (moving COBOL applications off mainframes)">AMC</abbr>
division of
~~[OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/)~~
[Rocket Software](https://www.rocketsoftware.com/)
).

I study walls on Bridgeland stability conditions for complexes of coherent
sheaves on Picard Rank 1 surfaces and threefolds.
This is an area of Algebraic Geometry.
At the moment, I'm interested in automating methods for finding walls, find out more
about this on the
[Pseudowalls page](pseudowalls).
